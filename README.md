## Overview
### Brief
The brief for this application is the following: To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
### Requirements
The requirements for the application are the following:
- A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for your project.
- A detailed Risk Assessment created at the beginning of your project.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, that you have covered during training, this application needs to meet the requirements set on your Kanban Board
- The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.
- Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.
- You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence that you have done so.
- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System
- Code built through a CI server
- Application deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine
